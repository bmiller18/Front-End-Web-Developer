    <!--paragraph and list item no closing tags-->
    <p>What causes errors in HTML?

      <ul>
        <!--first <strong> no closing tag causing the rest of the text to be strongly emphasized-->
        <li>Unclosed elements: If an element is <strong>not closed properly, than its effect can spread to areas you didn't intended
        
        <!--badly nested <strong> and <em>-->
        <li>Badly nested elements: Nesting elements properly is also very important for code behaving correctly. <strong>strong <em>
          strong emphasised?</strong> what is this?</em>
        
        <!--href missing closing double quotes causing link to never render-->
        <li>Unclosed attributes: Another common source of HTML problems. Let's look at an example: <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/>link 
          to Mozilla homepage</a>
      </ul>
